# Analysis of Perennial Blooms in North America

[Introduction]

Climate change has continuously proven to be a growing issue impacting global biodiversity and the ability of species to survive and propagate. In order to combat climate change, historical ecological solutions should be put under inspection. In the past, a large portion of carbon was sequestered by plant ecology, namely through perennial plants which persist beyond seasonality. Due to human development and agricultural intensification following the green revolution, tracts of forests everywhere were cut down subsequently lowering global carbon sequestration potential. In order to better understand the dynamics between climate change and perennial carbon sequestration, greater analyses are needed between the propagation of perennials and their environments. The significance of studying perennials is twofold: 1) The ubiquitous presence of perennials manifest the completion of an ecological succession [Priority Effects between Annual and Perennial plants, DeMalach and Fukami 2018] signifying a now stable ecosystem able to provide ecological services, and 2) The multi-year persistence of perennials enables these species to better store and sequester carbon for longer periods of time, thereby slowing down the rate of climate change.  

This study will select four species of perennials prominent throughout the United States: Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum), American Plum (Prunus americana), Common Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and Silver Buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea). The species ranges and their bloom patterns will be analyzed and compared to the correlating climate data in order to see if there is a relationship between blooms and climate. Furthermore, the ranges and seasonalities of each perennial species will be compared for similarities and differences in both scope and scale.
  
[Methods]

Using the Botanical Information and Ecology Network, an open source, decentralized hub of ecological information, I downloaded data relating specifically to bloom data of plant species only within the United States. In order to further limit the data set, I then restricted my analysis to the species which had the largest sample of records which led to the formulation of the five perennials under study: Silver Maple, American Plum, Common Dandelion, Silver Buffaloberry, and Sweet Clover.  Next climate data was downloaded from the PRISM climate database from Oregon State University which has open source records of 30 year temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm2) normals in raster format. In order to further analyze the relationship between the species range and climate, the species range spatial data was rasterized and plotted against the annual climate and precipitation data.
